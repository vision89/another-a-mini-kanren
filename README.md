# Another-A-Mini-Kanren
A simple mini kanren implementation in Racket

* Note that this repo has been renamed and moved to [Introducing Another MicroKanren](https://github.com/vision89/iamk)
* This was mostly implemented from ["Logic programming in scheme" by Nils M Holm](http://bit.ly/2CorDxX)
* Note that this is still a work in progress!  I am currently reading ["The Reasoned Schemer" by Daniel P. Friedman, Willeam E. Byrd and Oleg Kiselyov ](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reasoned-schemer) and I will be making updates as I learn more from this book and from working on small projects.
